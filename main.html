	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to express how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size. When evaluating algorithms we describe their Time complexity using asymptotic notation to compare approaches and pick the most efficient strategy; an efficient algorithm performs fewer steps as the input scales and usually leads to faster, more predictable execution.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> describes the extra memory an algorithm needs in terms of the input size. It is commonly expressed using Big-O notation â€” for example, an algorithm that requires linear additional memory would be written as O(n), indicating memory usage grows proportionally with n.</p>
